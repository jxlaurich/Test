The Golden Knights are a renowned circle of automaton guards created by the Bank of Glimoire in collaboration with the esteemed Gold Dragon Flight. Tasked with safeguarding their treasure vaults and the secrets within, these formidable constructs stand as vigilant sentinels against any who dare to trespass upon their domain. Under the command of Diorath, the de facto leader of the Gold Dragons, the Golden Knights have become synonymous with impenetrable defense and unwavering loyalty.

# Creation and Origins
The conception of the Golden Knights can be traced back to the halls of the Bank of Glimoire. Recognizing the threat posed by cunning thieves and the ever-present danger of betrayal, the Bank of Glimoire sought a guardian force capable of withstanding any assault. Aeliondara, the Arcane City, serves as the birthplace of these extraordinary automatons. Here, skilled artisans and engineers craft each Golden Knight with precision and care. Utilizing a closely guarded alloy known only to the highest echelons of the Bank of Glimoire, the construction of these guardians remains a closely held state secret, shrouded in mystery and legend.

# Design and Attributes
The Golden Knights are marvels of engineering, their design blending the elegance of clockwork mechanisms with the resilience of modern craftsmanship. Standing as towering sentinels clad in gilded armor, they exude an aura of indomitable strength and unwavering resolve. Each aspect of their construction is meticulously crafted, from the intricate engravings adorning their armor to the precise calibration of their internal mechanisms.

Within the heart of every Golden Knight lies a complex network of clockwork gears and pistons, meticulously arranged to facilitate movement and functionality. Powered by a unique energy source, the nature of which remains a closely guarded secret, these constructs possess an inexhaustible reservoir of strength and endurance.
