In the heart of Bastion, amidst the towering spires and bustling streets, lies an elite force like no other: the Silver-Scales. These formidable warriors are not born; they are forged through years of rigorous training, discipline, and sacrifice, molded into living weapons capable of defending the city against any threat.

# The Path of the Silver-Scales:

From a young age, boys destined to become Silver-Scales undergo a grueling initiation process that shapes their bodies and minds for the challenges ahead. Their fathers, themselves former Silver-Scales, tie heavy stones to their wrists, forcing their arms to hang at their sides, constantly straining against the weight. This relentless burden serves as the foundation of their training, building strength and endurance from the earliest years of their lives.

# A Spartan Existence:

The life of a would-be Silver-Scale is one of austerity and discipline. Fed high-protein diets devoid of indulgences like honey and grain, and nourished solely on wolves' milk until they can chew, these boys know only the taste of raw meat and root vegetables for the rest of their lives. On their birthdays, they receive no gifts; instead, they are bestowed with new, heavier stones to further develop their muscles, a testament to the relentless pursuit of physical perfection.

# The Trial of the Stones:

At the age of sixteen, the young aspirants face their most daunting challenge yet: the Trial of the Stones. Millstones are tied to their wrists, and they must carry this crushing weight until their seventeenth birthday. Only those who endure this trial with unwavering determination and resilience are deemed worthy to join the ranks of the Silver-Scales. Upon reaching the age of seventeen and successfully passing the Trial of the Stones, the chosen few are permitted to don the legendary Silver-Scale Armor. Crafted from the finest materials and imbued with powerful enchantments, this armor is a symbol of honor and prestige, marking its wearer as a guardian of Bastion and its people.

# Masters of Combat:

Trained in the art of warfare from a young age, the Silver-Scales are fearsome adversaries on the battlefield. Their sword thrusts are so powerful that they must blunt their blades to prevent slicing their enemies in half in one stroke, prolonging the battle to gain experience and muscle mass; they treat warfare as pure exercise. As a result of their intimidating presence, crime in Bastion has hovered at near zero as far back as city records can trace the founding of the Scales.
