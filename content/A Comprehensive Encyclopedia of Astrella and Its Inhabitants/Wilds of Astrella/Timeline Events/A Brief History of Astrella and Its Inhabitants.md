>*"Yes, Ms. Glitterscales, your pension will be quite secure here in the bank, no higher security in all the realms!"* - Crick, former employee of the Bank of Glimoire

The Great Glimoire Heist, though it targeted only a single patron, whose horde was insured by the Bank, nonetheless shattered public trust in the bank. Stock prices tumbled overnight, there were several runs on gold as panic spread and desperate dragons sought to get their treasure out of the banks and back into their pocket hordes. The money supply cratered overnight, and nearly caused a recession the likes unseen in Glimoire.

Through shrewd business acumen, bribery, and outright blackmail, Diorath was able to tip the scales back in the bank's favor by strong-arming the Glimoire Council to raise interest rates to 50 percent, something no properly greed-obsessed dragon could ignore. Gold flooded back into the bank as dragons chased this inflated return. Diorath could forgive a bit of stolen treasure, but he had to make an example of the thieves. Never come between a dragon and his wealth.

>*"I want the Robertsons found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast, NOW!"* - Rowan

The Kiln Riot, an otherwise unremarkable event in the history of Astrella, would prove to be one of the most monumental in its history. Through the incompetence of its guards, a massive riot led by an unlikely coalition of the Robertson brothers and a mob of orcs fomented within the walls of the Kiln, killing a majority of the guards and prisoners. The Robertson brothers, and the rest of Rob's Golden Horde, escaped into the desert. Days later, they would encounter the Deck.

# Deck of Many Things and the Rebirth of Astrella, Winterwane 1166 B.B.

>*"Step into my parlor, said the spider to the fly."* - Ancient Astrellan Saying

Mere days after the prison riot, the party encountered a small hut in a strangely forested area of Sunderdune. The woman who lived there, in an act of hospitality, or perhaps an act of schadenfreude, offered anyone in the party who cared to partake a card from the deck of many things. It was this moment that would redefine the fate of Astrella. Bob pulled an illogically beneficial series of cards, showering himself in riches. Along with the Fate card. Bob wished for Erboa to be alive and the party to be back in Squall, undoing a year and a half of time. Something erred, however, and events changed even farther back. The City of Bastion, once a dead and dusty ruin, was now alive and well. The full reach of these consequences is yet to be felt, in the new era of A.B. After Bob.

The party now has regained their memories, less Bob, the creator of their new timeline. Though they continue to ridicule him for his apparent stupidity, they do not realize that they speak like this to their creator. There are whispers in corners of Astrella, of golden-haired, crude paintings on cave walls; of squat, potbellied statues of good luck. These oddities have never been fully identified, and the Glimoire Archaeological Guild has deemed that these are similar, but not identical, spirits of good cheer and friendship.

Perhaps.
