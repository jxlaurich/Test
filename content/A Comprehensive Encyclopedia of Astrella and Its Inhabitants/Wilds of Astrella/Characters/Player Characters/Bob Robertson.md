### Arrival in [[Squall]]
Bob Robertson first made his presence known in the village when he unexpectedly participated in a log-rolling contest the day after his arrival. Despite claiming ignorance about the competition, Robertson not only emerged victorious but also set a record for the fastest completion time. This marked the beginning of a series of athletic feats that would soon solidify his reputation in the town.

### Rise to Grand Champion

As Robertson continued to outperform all challengers, he maintained an air of obliviousness to his own prowess. The townsfolk, however, quickly recognized the fire of a true gladiator burning within him. With the strength of a raging bull, the ferocity of an agile cheetah, and the compassion of a saint, Bob Robertson ascended to the esteemed position of the town's Grand Champion, earning the title "Champion of [[Squall]]."

### Promotion to Party Leader and Yetislayer
In an unexpected turn of events, Bob Robertson found himself thrust into a leadership role when [[Duvir]], the mayor of [[Squall]], appointed him as the head of an expedition to [[Erboa]]'s Roost. The task was to deliver offerings in celebration of [[Erboa]]'s arrival—an honor that carried great responsibility. Despite Bob's chronic lack of confidence and indecision, [[Duvir]] saw qualities of unwavering loyalty and faithfulness in him, deeming him fit to lead the party.

Accompanying Bob on this crucial mission were his fraternal twin brother, [[Rob Robertson]], the enigmatic [[Omouraxanandotha]], and the thri-kreen [[rogue]] Kervuc-Yu. As the party ventured to [[Erboa]]'s Roost, they unwittingly raided the sacred vault of [[Erboa]], defiling the hallowed grounds in their quest. Among the treasures they uncovered were the Formless Blade—a blade made of pure ice with the ability to extend to 15 feet and navigate around corners—the [[Goodberry]] Hat, and Maurice, the Right Hand of [[Erboa]]. This talking glove held the ancient knowledge of magical artifacts and the history of Glimoire, home of the Golden Dragon Flight atop the Worldtree.

Tragedy struck when the party discovered [[Erboa]] slain by unknown assailants. Minutes later, [[Squall]], their hometown, met its demise in an unknown blast, leaving the party to grapple with the shock and devastation. The Wild Horn, a precious artifact, was passed to [[Omouraxanandotha]]. In the aftermath of the cataclysmic events, the party found themselves plummeting many miles from the sky to the treacherous [[Wyldrfrost]] below. Miraculously surviving the fall, they faced the daunting task of navigating the harsh terrain to reach Mount Oron. Their journey was fraught with challenges, including encounters with polar bears and a hive of yetis. Fueled by the determination to survive, the party slew the yetis and adopted a yeti cub in the process. Kervuc-Yu bestowed the name Kervuc-Me upon the cub, marking a heartwarming bond forged amidst the unforgiving landscape. Bob became known as Yetislayer until his death later that year. Outside of the caves, a hooded figure sat next to a fire, unable to warm himself. He asked the party for assistance, but Omoura insisted they banish the creature. The hooded figure escaped before Rob could capture him in his Tome of Memory. This would later prove to be Endis, leader of the Black Dragon Flight.

### Promotion to Trollslayer and Demise
At Mount Oron, a new threat emerged in the form of a giant terrorizing the local [[Eladrin]] population. The desperate pleas for help from the distressed inhabitants stirred the heroic instincts within Bob Robertson. Unable to turn away from those in need, he insisted on aiding the [[Eladrin]] in their time of peril. To neutralize the giant, [[Omouraxanandotha]] devised a cunning plan, setting a trap to freeze the creature in ice. Bob, true to his nature, volunteered to stay up and watch over the bait, ensuring the success of their strategy. The trap worked flawlessly, encasing the giant in an icy prison.

However, the commotion attracted the attention of an even more formidable foe—a three-headed troll. In the ensuing battle, Bob fought with unmatched ferocity, delivering relentless blows upon the three-headed troll with his trusty axe. The lone [[dwarf]] stood like a demon, clawing his way out of hell, determined to protect his comrades and the vulnerable [[Eladrin]]. His unwavering courage and selflessness shone brightly in the face of impending danger.

Despite his valiant efforts, Bob found himself overpowered by the relentless assault of the three-headed troll. In the harrowing struggle, he suffered severe injuries, losing an arm in the process. As his life force dwindled, Bob passed away in the arms of his grief-stricken brother, [[Rob Robertson]]. The party, arriving just moments too late to save Bob, struck the final blow to the troll in vengeance for their fallen comrade. In recognition of his selfless sacrifice and pivotal role in the troll's defeat, Bob Robertson was posthumously bestowed with the honorific "Trollslayer." His legacy lived on in the hearts of those he had protected, a testament to the [[dwarf]]'s indomitable spirit and unwavering commitment to the cause.

### Revivification
In a twist of fate, the departed hero, Bob Robertson, found himself resurrected by the enigmatic leader of the Black Dragon Flight, Endis. However, this second chance at life came at a staggering cost—a Faustian bargain that would bind Bob to a dark destiny.

Endis granted Bob six months of existence as a Deathknight, an undead warrior fueled by powers from beyond the grave. Though granted extraordinary abilities, Bob's renewed existence was marred by constant pain and torment. The spectral essence that coursed through his veins served as a constant reminder of the perilous bargain he had struck. In exchange for this stay of execution, Bob was bound by an oath to seek out Endis once more and receive a task from the leader of the Black Dragon Flight. Only by completing this mysterious task would Bob be granted full restoration to life, free from the shackles of undeath that gripped him.

As Bob embarked on his quest, the nature of the task remained shrouded in mystery, leaving him to grapple with the consequences of his Faustian bargain. The shadows of the Black Dragon Flight loomed over him, and the undying hero faced a race against time to fulfill his end of the dark pact and reclaim his place among the living.

### Enslavement and Escape

Bob, resurrected and bound by a dark pact, led the party on a perilous journey to the World Tree. There, they encountered the foul undead dragon [[Graven]] and his mysterious master, a hooded figure named Endis. The hooded figure's identity, whether a different version of the one who resurrected Bob or an entity sharing the same name, remained obscured. In a fierce battle, the party faced near annihilation at the hands of [[Graven]] and Endis. Miraculously, they managed to escape on the ship they had painstakingly restored during their time at Mount Oron. The crew fought valiantly, blasting [[Graven]] with cannonballs as they made their desperate escape from the clutches of the undead dragon and his enigmatic master.

Following their narrow escape, the party discovered the means to unlock the Vaults of Glimoire within the bottomless chest left by the long-gone Captain Dell, a bronze dragon. Seizing the opportunity, they embarked on a daring robbery of the vaults, navigating through Omoura's horde portal to make a swift getaway. Their audacious heist did not go unnoticed, as [[Diorath]], the manager of the Bank of Glimoire, and his Golden Knights swiftly apprehended the party upon their return. Faced with a dire choice between forced labor or death, the party reluctantly chose the former. For the next six months, they toiled under the watchful eyes of their captors, laboring across the realms to repay their extraordinary debt.

While performing hard labor in the Sunderdune pit mine known as The Kiln, a riot erupted, providing the party with an opportunity to escape. In the chaos, they fought their way out, with the sacrifice of the War-Forged Cleric Nemo allowing them precious time to arm themselves. The retaliation was swift and brutal, claiming the lives of [[Draga]] the slaver, the Ogre overseer, and [[Rowan]], the mine's owner.

[[Diorath]], displeased with the party's actions, intervened and ordered them to Ozryn Crossroads for what would be their final task. With a heavy burden on their shoulders and the desert sands stretching ahead, the party departed, uncertain of the challenges that awaited them in Ozryn Crossroads. The shadows of their past and the consequences of their choices lingered, casting a long and foreboding shadow over their journey.

### [[Deck of Many Things]] and the Recasting of Astrella

Shortly after their daring escape from The Kiln, the party, including the ever-embattled Bob Robertson, stumbled upon a mystical artifact—the infamous [[Deck of Many Things]]. Temptation overcame caution, and each party member drew a card from the enigmatic deck, with Bob's draw proving to be the most momentous. As Bob pulled the card, the Fate Card revealed itself, offering him a single wish—a power that could reshape the very fabric of reality. Driven by a desire to undo the tragic events that had befallen [[Erboa]] and the party, Bob spoke the wish that would alter the course of history in Astrella.

In an instant, the world remade itself, erasing the scars of their past and rewriting the narrative of their lives. Astrella entered a new age, measured in years AB (After Bob). The party found themselves in an unfamiliar reality, devoid of the memories that had once burdened them.

Gradually, the party began to recover fragments of their past lives, piecing together the puzzle of the rewritten world. It became apparent that they had mere days to save [[Erboa]] from her impending demise. While the party regained their memories one by one, Bob remained an enigma. The wish he had made, fueled by a desperate longing to alter fate, left him devoid of recollections of his past. As his companions worked tirelessly to unravel the mysteries of their shared history, Bob remained unaware of the profound consequences of his fateful wish.

With the clock ticking and the shadow of impending doom looming over [[Erboa]], the party faced the daunting task of piecing together the threads of their past and orchestrating a salvation that would reshape the destiny of Astrella once again. The age of AB had begun, leaving the world in the unpredictable hands of Bob Robertson and the remnants of a past erased but not forgotten.
