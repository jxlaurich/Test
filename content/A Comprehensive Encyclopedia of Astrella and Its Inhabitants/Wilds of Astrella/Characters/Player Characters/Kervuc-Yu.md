### Performance as Squall's Mailman
Excerpt from a review of the Squall Post Office from a travelling Bastion merchant:

"Beware, travelers of Squall, for I must warn you of the dismal experience that awaits at the mail office run by Kervuc-Yu, the Thri-Kreen. It's a place where parcels disappear into thin air, service is as scarce as water in the desert, bugs skitter and scatter with wild abandon, and your thoughts are not your own thanks to invasive telepathy.

Let me begin with the chaos that reigns within this establishment. Packages entrusted to Kervuc-Yu are more likely to vanish into the ether than reach their intended recipients. It seems the concept of efficient mail delivery is lost on this Thri-Kreen, much like the parcels themselves. And should you dare to inquire about the whereabouts of your missing goods, be prepared for a mind invasion, as Kervuc-Yu insists on prying into your thoughts rather than offering any semblance of customer service.

Adding insult to injury is Kervuc-Yu's utter inability to communicate verbally. Instead, patrons are subjected to the awkward dance of attempting to decipher the Thri-Kreen's cryptic gestures and clicks, all while bugs of various sizes scuttle about, adding an extra layer of discomfort.

But perhaps the most egregious offense of all is Kervuc-Yu's penchant for hide-and-seek. The moment you step foot into the office, the Thri-Kreen disappears into the shadows, leaving you stranded and bewildered, unable to complete your business. And just when you think you're finally rid of the pest, beware, for Kervuc-Yu may attempt to stow away in your belongings as you make your hasty retreat.

In light of these egregious transgressions, I implore Mayor Duvir to intervene and bring an end to this farce of a mail office. Squall deserves better than Kervuc-Yu's incompetence and invasive antics. It's time to shut down this debacle and replace it with a more competent and customer-friendly alternative. The residents of Squall deserve a mail service they can rely on, not one plagued by lost packages, poor service, and telepathic intrusion."

### Early Life and Transformation

Little is known about Kervuc-Yu's early life prior to his stint as a mailman in Squall. Some speculate he was born amidst the windswept dunes of the desert, while others whisper of a shadowed upbringing in the depths of the forest. Regardless of his origins, it was the death of Erboa, a being revered by many as a protector of the forest, that catalyzed Kervuc-Yu's transformation from a mundane mailman into a hardened adventurer.

### Legendary Feats

Kervuc-Yu's exploits are the stuff of legend, recounted in hushed tones by tavern patrons and bards alike. Among his most infamous deeds is the audacious robbery of the Bank of Glimoire, a feat accomplished with the aid of his compatriots Omoura, Nemo, and the infamous duo Bob and Rob Robertson. The heist sent shockwaves throughout the realm and solidified Kervuc-Yu's reputation as a master thief.

Another of Kervuc-Yu's legendary feats is his role in the Battle of Thomas's Farm, where he and a band of brave adventurers confronted the dragon Alderanth. With his lightning-quick reflexes and deadly accuracy with light hand crossbows, Kervuc-Yu played a pivotal role in slaying the fearsome beast, avenging the death of Thomas and securing victory for his comrades.

But perhaps one of Kervuc-Yu's most unusual feats is the capture and taming of a Yeti cub, whom he affectionately named Kervuc-Me. Despite initial skepticism from his companions, Kervuc-Yu saw potential in the young Yeti and took it upon himself to instruct the creature in the basic arts of navigation and thievery. Legend has it that Kervuc-Yu even went so far as to tie Kervuc-Me to the wheel of his ship to expedite his training

### Deck of Many Things
Kervuc pulled two cards of note from the deck. The first was The Tower card, bequeathing him a castle somewhere in the world. The consequences of the card have not yet manifested, nor has that of his other, a card which sent him to a dimension of flame and torment. It remains to be seen if these cards have followed Kervuc into the A.B. era.
