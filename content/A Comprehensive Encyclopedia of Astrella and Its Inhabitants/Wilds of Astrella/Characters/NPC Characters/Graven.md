The Green dragon flight, entrusted with safeguarding the equilibrium of Astrella's natural realms, serves as the stalwart defenders of Edelbloom. Complementary to the duties of their brethren in the White dragon flight, the Greens are bound by tradition and hierarchy, with the eldest among them assuming leadership. Their allegiance extends beyond mere mortal bounds, for they answer to the Unifier, the bearer of The Wild Horn and the blessings of each seasonal realm—a position currently held by Erboa.

Wherever calamity strikes, Graven and his kin stood ready to mend the tapestry of nature, embodying the essence of restoration and renewal. Their abodes, nestled within the serene groves of Edelbloom, serve as sanctuaries of ancient wisdom and tranquility amidst the chaos of the world.

# Legacy of Restoration

Graven's name resonates throughout Astrella as a paragon of restoration magic. His unparalleled mastery over the forces of renewal ensured that no curse, disease, or corruption could endure within the world's embrace. Through his teachings, Graven bestowed upon his kin the knowledge and power to uphold the sanctity of nature, imparting a legacy that would endure for generations.

Yet, Graven's influence transcends mere magic; it embodies a profound reverence for the natural order. In adherence to tradition, he established a precedent for the orderly transition of power within the Green dragon flight. As elders reach the twilight of their existence, they depart from the flight to seek their final resting place—a sacred ritual wherein their power returns to the embrace of Astrella's cycle. Historians and adventurers alike are drawn to the mystery of these final resting sites, seeking the remnants of a dragon's essence infused into the land.

# The Hunt for Graven's Resting Place

Despite the passage of eons, the location of Graven's final resting place remains shrouded in mystery. While the lineage of the Green flight has left its mark upon the land, Graven's sanctuary eludes even the most intrepid explorers. Legend has it that Graven held a fondness for the elusive Purple Lotus, a rare bloom that flourishes within the heart of Edelbloom. Thus, it is speculated that his final sanctuary may be found amidst the tranquil embrace of these enchanted blossoms.

The druid drakes of Edelbloom, stewards of the land and keepers of ancient wisdom, offer cryptic clues to seekers embarking on the quest for Graven's sanctuary. Yet, the journey is fraught with peril and uncertainty, for the secrets of a legendary dragon are not easily unveiled.

# Fall from Grace

At some point, Graven either fell to darkness, or was compelled to it. Though little is known of the entity referred to as Graven, it bears no resemblance to its noble namesake. Rather, it is a remarkably dangerous beast, killing at least three dragonborn among the ruins of Bastion during the events of Winterrise B.B.
