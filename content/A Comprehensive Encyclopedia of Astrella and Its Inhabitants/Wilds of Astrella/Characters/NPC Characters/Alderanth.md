### Legend

For decades, Alderanth held sway over the coastal waters of Astrella, striking fear into the hearts of fishermen who dared to venture too far from shore. With his immense size and razor-sharp claws, he would swoop down upon unsuspecting vessels, tearing through nets and stealing the precious bounty of the sea. His raids were swift and merciless, leaving fishermen destitute and villages reeling from the loss of their livelihoods.

In addition to terrorizing the fishermen of Astrella, Alderanth was known to amass a modest hoard of treasure, plundered from the treasuries of small settlements along the coast. Though the exact extent of his horde remains unknown, tales abound of Alderanth's penchant for collecting gold and jewels, which he would hoard in the depths of his lair, hidden away from prying eyes.

Despite the efforts of brave adventurers and would-be dragon slayers, Alderanth's hoard has remained elusive, its fate shrouded in mystery. Some believe that the treasure lies hidden somewhere along the rugged coastline of Astrella, buried beneath the sands or nestled within the caverns of the sea cliffs. Others speculate that Alderanth's horde was lost to the depths of the ocean, claimed by the churning waters that surround the island.

### Death

Alderanth was ultimately slain by the Squall Welcoming Committee, after Thomas's death at the hands of his mephit servants. Bob Robertson gave his life, before being resurrected a short time later, by holding dynamite in his mouth and pressing himself to Alderanth's neck, gravely wounding the dragon. Unathal also perished for a time, taking a direct blast of Alderanth's lightning and dying instantly.

Rob Robertson continued pour withering fire at Alderanth from inside Thomas's house, unaware of the death of his brother. [[[[Kervuc-Yu]]|[[Kervuc-]]Yu]] baited the dragon around the farm, keeping him occupied while Rob fired upon his turned flank, and Khalir attempted to escape the burning barn. Alderanth was finally finished by a series of devastating attacks from Zonnym, the Collector.
