### Background:

Crick's origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that he was once the accountant for Captain Dell's treasure horde. Captain Dell, a bronze dragon with a penchant for seafaring mischief, somehow acquired Crick during his numerous exploits. The exact circumstances of how Crick ended up in the bottomless chest remain unclear, but it is speculated that Captain Dell's love for accumulating treasures led him to acquire this peculiar [[goblin]].

### Adventures with the Party:

A party of adventurers, consisting of Bob & [[Rob Robertson]], [[Omouraxanandotha]], Nemo, and Kervuc-Yu, stumbled upon Crick while looting Captain Dell's chest. Recognizing the [[goblin]]'s unique skills, the party decided to take him under their wing. To motivate and integrate him into the group, they promoted Crick to the position of Senior Accountant, a title that he proudly embraced.

### Wrongful Termination and Bank Heist:

Unfortunately, Crick's newfound employment didn't last long. The adventurers, in a moment of daring mischief, convinced Crick to aid them in robbing the vault of Auroryn, the esteemed patron of the Bank of Glimoire. This act led to Crick's wrongful termination from the bank, with accusations of collusion and embezzlement. After the heist, Crick was separated from the party, and it was during this time that he faced a peculiar fate. The manager of the Bank of Glimoire, Lord [[Diorath]], subjected Crick to an unknown debility, erasing portions of his memories and altering his personality. Sold into slavery, Crick's mind was further affected, leaving him a mere shadow of his former self.

### Reunion with the Party:

The party, in their subsequent adventures, stumbled upon Crick once again, now enslaved and mentally ravaged. Despite their attempts to free him, it became evident that the mind wipe had taken a toll on Crick, leaving him a mere shell of the once vibrant treasure [[goblin]] accountant. His tragic fate serves as a cautionary tale of the consequences of meddling with powerful entities and engaging in dubious activities. After 1165 A.B., Crick's status in the new world is unknown.
