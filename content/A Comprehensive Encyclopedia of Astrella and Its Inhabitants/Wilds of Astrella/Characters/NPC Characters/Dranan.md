### Mining Tragedy and Skysteel Mishap

Dranan Ironhammer, the less fortunate twin brother of [[Squall]]'s esteemed mayor [[Duvir]], toiled as a miner in the Skysteel mines. Fate took a cruel turn when an explosion rocked the mines, leaving Dranan with a thick shard of Skysteel wedged in his frontal lobe. The severity of the injury necessitated immediate surgery, and the only option available was [[Tana]]'s father, Harlan, an established alchemist with limited training in surgery. Harlan's surgery was a success in saving Dranan's life, but the Skysteel shard left a permanent mark on his mental faculties. Dranan now found himself mentally impaired, gibbering nonsense and attaching himself to a pet rat named Sneeble. Despite his impaired state, Dranan's unique form of madness revealed itself in his extreme out-of-the-box thinking, transforming him into an artisan with a penchant for the unconventional.

### [[Duvir]]'s Involvement

[[Duvir]], haunted by the guilt of causing the accident through increased quotas in Dranan's mine section, took responsibility for his brother's well-being. He paid for Dranan's house and ensured his comfort, allowing him to live a relatively stable life despite his mental condition. However, [[Duvir]] chose to bear the burden of guilt silently, distancing himself from the town's memory of their familial connection. The once-close brothers became strangers, their bond overshadowed by the tragedy [[Duvir]] believed he had caused.

### Dranan's Eclectic Workshop

In the heart of [[Squall]], Dranan resides in an eclectic workshop filled with the remnants of his explosive and creative endeavors. While his madness renders him incapable of conventional work, Dranan's out-of-the-box thinking has led to the creation of useful items such as dynamite and glue bombs. Despite his impaired mental state, he remains a beloved figure in [[Squall]], known for his eccentricity and the company of his faithful companion, Sneeble.
