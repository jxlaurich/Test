The icy expanse of Wyldrfrost, a vast continent-sized region near the bottom of Astrella on the World Tree, is home to the enigmatic [[Eladrin]]; a stoic and suspicious people, their interactions with foreigners characterized by caution rather than outright hostility. The tribes hold a vital role in Astrella, providing raw materials essential for the flourishing desertous region of Sunderdune.

### Government and Politics
Wyldrfrost is a collection of mid-sized central settlements, governed by a tribal confederation led by Felaerin. The [[Eladrin]] maintain a delicate balance within their society, ensuring that each individual plays a vital role in their communal survival. The villages are the heart of their governance, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility.

### Economic Landscape
Economically, Wyldrfrost operates on a regulated barter system. The annual GDP per capita stands at 100 gold, a testament to the resilience of the [[Eladrin]] in their challenging environment. Key exports include pelts and timber, sought after for their quality and magical properties. In return, Wyldrfrost imports forged tools, pottery, and the famed Rockvine Berry Wine, a unique beverage crafted from the berries found amidst the rocky terrain.

### Relations with Sunderdune
Tensions have simmered between the [[Eladrin]] and the Sunderdune people, whose slavers frequently raid the Wyldrfrost for labor. In response, the [[Eladrin]] employ guerrilla tactics and acts of barbarity, aiming not just to repel invaders but to instill terror in those who dare encroach upon their lands. Despite this tumultuous relationship, trade continues to thrive between the two regions, as the [[Eladrin]]'s resources are a lifeline for Sunderdune.

### Sunderdune Gate Crisis
Recent times have brought uncertainty to Wyldrfrost. The border gate to Sunderdune has been closed, leaving ships and a growing number of [[Eladrin]] refugees stranded, seeking employment and economic stability in Sunderdune's cities and mines. The crisis at the border threatens not only the economic balance but the very way of life for the [[Eladrin]], as they grapple with an unforeseen challenge to their age-old traditions. The outcome of this crisis remains uncertain, casting a shadow over the usually resilient and resourceful people of Wyldrfrost.
