# Biology and Physiology of the Eladrin
The Eladrin, a distinct race of blue-skinned elves inhabiting the frigid realm of [[Wyldrfrost]], exhibit unique biological and physiological traits finely tuned to endure the harsh arctic environment they call home.

## Physical Characteristics
### Appearance:
Eladrin are known for their tall, lean, and agile frames, standing notably taller than their woodland [[elf]] counterparts. Their distinctive blue skin complements piercing blue eyes, while their hair, often white or silver, adds an ethereal touch to their appearance. The combination of these features gives the Eladrin an otherworldly and striking presence.

### Adaptations:
Cold Resistance: The Eladrin's blue skin is not merely an aesthetic feature; it provides natural resistance to the extreme cold temperatures of [[Wyldrfrost]], offering them protection against frostbite and chilling winds.

### Keen Perception
Piercing blue eyes are adapted to the low light conditions prevalent in the arctic region, granting the Eladrin exceptional vision during the perpetual twilight of the polar nights.

## Dietary Habits
The Eladrin sustenance primarily revolves around a diet of Snowshade Stag meat, a hardy creature adapted to the arctic climate. These creatures provide a vital source of protein and nutrients, sustaining the Eladrin in their challenging environment. Complementing this, Eladrin cultivate and consume hearty root vegetables capable of surviving the cold, such as frost-resistant tubers and underground greens.

## Lifespan and Reproduction
### Lifespan:
Eladrin enjoy a notably extended lifespan, often reaching several centuries. Their longevity is attributed to a combination of their connection with the magical energies of [[Wyldrfrost]] and their overall resilience to environmental challenges.

### Gestation Period:
The gestation period for Eladrin is slightly longer than that of other elven races, lasting around 18 months. This prolonged period is believed to contribute to the development of robust and adaptive offspring.

### Mating Rituals:
Eladrin value unity and cooperation, and their mating rituals reflect these ideals. Partnerships are often forged through a combination of mutual respect, shared experiences, and an acknowledgment of each other's strengths. Ceremonial dances under the shimmering northern lights are common during courtship, symbolizing the celestial bond between potential mates.

## Unique Adaptations
### Frostweaving Magic:
Some Eladrin possess an inherent connection to the magical essence of frost, allowing them to manipulate ice and snow through a form of innate frostweaving. This ability is often harnessed for practical purposes, such as crafting tools, creating temporary shelters, or enhancing their combat prowess.

### Winter's Embrace:
During times of extreme cold, Eladrin can enter a state known as "Winter's Embrace," slowing their metabolism to conserve energy. This adaptation allows them to endure prolonged periods without food and endure the harshest weather conditions.

The biology and physiology of the Eladrin reflect the intricacies of their environment in [[Wyldrfrost]]. From their striking physical features to their dietary habits and unique adaptations, these beings have evolved to thrive in a realm where resilience and adaptability are paramount.

# History
The history of the Eladrin in [[Wyldrfrost]] is shrouded in mystery, with the origins of these enigmatic beings veiled in the icy mists of time. Their first appearance in the frigid expanses of [[Wyldrfrost]] remains a subject of speculation and myth, intertwining with the harsh landscape they now call home. The murky origins of the Eladrin trace back to the time when the frost-covered mountains of [[Wyldrfrost]] were untouched by sentient beings. Legends speak of their emergence as guardians of the icy realm. The exact circumstances of their arrival, however, remain a subject of debate among scholars and storytellers.

## Border Conflicts with Sunderdune
The Eladrin, resilient in their frosty abode, have endured centuries of conflict with the Sunderdune slavers. Frequently targeted for their valuable resources, the Eladrin developed guerilla tactics and fierce defenses to repel the invaders. Tales of these conflicts have been immortalized in heroic epics, with ancient Eladrin braves celebrated for their valor and cunning.

## Unification and Mount Oron
The scattered Eladrin tribes, recognizing the strength in unity, experienced a transformative moment in their history. A legendary chief, Lorian Frostwhisper, successfully united the tribes into a powerful confederation. The great unification took place at what is now the de facto capital of the Eladrin, Mount Oron, a majestic peak that overlooks the sprawling [[Wyldrfrost]].

The tribal confederation, under the leadership of Lorian, ushered in a new era for the Eladrin. Mount Oron became a symbol of their unity and resilience, a place where the leaders convened to ensure the survival and prosperity of their people amidst the ever-present challenges of the arctic landscape.
