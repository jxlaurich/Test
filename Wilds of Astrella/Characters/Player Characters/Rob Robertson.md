### Early Life and Slayer Oath
Rob Robertson was a promising apprentice blackthumb. He was promised to the buxom Haelga Triggvesdottir, the daughter of his employer and third cousin to King Lunn PigRider. He wore fine gold rings in his beard, and lived a life of comfort and plenty.

But dwarves are stubborn folk. His master used the same techniques taught for the last thousand years. Rob knew he would one day take the shop when he married the fair Haelga, and sought to make his mark with the guild. He drafted plans for a suit of armor, the next phase of Dwarven warfare. He concocted great warmachines, thick plated armor, and he begun to experiment with black powder. Long have the dwarves used the substance, but little have they developed it. He designed a repeating rifle, though never properly refined it.

Dwarves live long lives. It could be a full century for his current master to pass on to the ancestral halls. Rob, impatient, decided to act. During one of King Lunn's weekly feasts, he unveiled his schematics to the entire clan, and called for investors. King Lunn, who would have normally been delighted at the smith's ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit, recognized the grave dishonor Rob had committed against his cousin Triggve. He ordered Rob's designs to be burnt and their ashes scattered. Rob himself was forced to take the slayer oath, shaving his head except for his crest of dyed red hair. He was cast out from his clan, and honor bound to seek a mighty doom at the hands of a worthy foe.

### Conflict with Mother's Milk
During a late night carouse at Mount Oron's watering hole, Rob made himself a bitter enemy of the [[Eladrin]] brave known as Mother's Milk. Rob was too drunk to remember the cause of the offense, but the warrior refused to allow Rob to walk away. While leaving the settlement, Mother's Milk and a gang of restless [[Eladrin]] bushwhacked the party, but were promptly killed by the party, in self defense. The were promptly dumped into a nearby canyon without ceremony, to prevent conflict with the [[Eladrin]].

### Death of Bob
Bob's death shook Rob to his very core, and his unexpected resurrection even more-so. Rob found it difficult to move past Bob's unnatural state, but in time recognized the loyal soul of his brother still inside, and whole. Rob swore to stay by his side, never let him feel alone, and boost his confidence back to the party leader he knew he could be.

### Rising the Ranks of the Slaver's Guild
Rob became known for his habit of increasing the efficiencies of the mining operations he was forced to labor in. However, he treated the event more as a vacation than a punishment. Diorath had ordered a [[dwarf]] to swing a pickaxe, break rocks, and move mine carts. Rob remembered doing this for fun back in the stronghold he grew up in, and took to the work with gusto, to the chagrin of his fellow captives.

Rob would regularly insist that the mine operators increase working hours, and go depper and deeper into dangerous and unexplored areas of the mines. Profits soared, and Rob became affectionately known as Uncle Rob, by both the slavers and slaves alike. His upward career trajectory was halted, however, during an unfortunate incident in the Kiln's cafeteria that led to a full blown riot, led by his brother in an ill-guided attempt to rescue him. During the revolt, Rob came to possess Lucent Destroyer, a powerful blunderbuss imbued with magic, after killing his former employer Rowan.
