### Early Life
A Bronze Dragon from Veilum, Omouraxanandotha was born to two aristocratic Bronze Dragons who, though powerful in their own right as all dragons are, did not stand out amongst their peers. Still young, Omoura set out into the world as most of his age do, seeking adventure, treasure, and the experiences that would shape him into an adult.
