Not much is known of Digos, though presumably his "masters" meet with ill fates, or there might be something more known. Notwithstanding, there are certain events which could be explained by a rogue Djinn over the centuries:

> | The Sunderdune Flood | In 569 B.B., an illogically large flood occurred in Sunderdune. The viziers of Aeliondara could not explain the flood, and so a small expedition was launched to discover the source of the water. At first, it was believed that there may be a new spring, which would bring untold prosperity to Sunderdune. As the expedition neared the origin of the water in their boats, they were stunned. A small island, with a single skeleton and a bronze rubbed lamp still held in his lifeless fingers. |
> | The Mad Scholar | In 724 B.B., in Aeliondara, not far from the first incident, a scholar was found wandering the streets unclothed, gibbering madness and clutching a bronze lamp, matching the exact description of the first lamp. |
> | The Gold Pirate | In 976 B.B., a ruthless pirate, name unknown, seems to have come into contact with a lamp, possibly the same one. He was discovered by his crew to have turned into a solid gold statue, lamp in hand. |

Digos is currently being investigated by the Glimoire Special Task Unit for unauthorized entry into a dragon's vault. Concurrently, he is being investigated by the Djinn Integrity Institute, for aiding and abetting adventurers without ironic or humorous consequence. He faces either an eternity in Glimoire's notorious prison system, or losing his license with the Djinn. We reached out for comment, but Digos declined an interview.
