# Background

[[Rowan]]'s initial encounter with Draga unfolded during a job fair for enforcers and taskmasters. Draga's intimidating presence and unparalleled mastery of brutal techniques set him apart from the crowd, prompting [[Rowan]] to extend an offer of employment. Impressed by Draga's dedication to enslavement arts, [[Rowan]] recognized the potential for the [[ogre]] to become an indispensable asset in maintaining control over The Kiln's incarcerated population.

Upon joining The Kiln's ranks as a slave driver, Draga quickly established his dominance over both prisoners and guards alike. The prison's hierarchical structure became a battlefield, with ambitious guards seeking to rise in rank through murder and deceit. However, all harbored a shared fear of Draga's merciless authority. Draga's ruthless subordination of his fellow guards became legendary within the prison walls. Through a series of brutal examples, including ripping insubordinate guards in half lengthwise, he solidified his position as the undisputed enforcer of [[Rowan]]'s will. Draga's reign of terror served as a stark warning to those who dared challenge his authority, creating an atmosphere of fear and subservience.

The Kiln witnessed a wave of internal conflict as guards engaged in deadly power struggles, each seeking to outdo the other to climb the prison's hierarchy. However, Draga's imposing presence loomed over every ambitious guard, curbing their ruthless aspirations with the sheer terror of potential consequences. Guards who once vied for supremacy soon found themselves reluctantly bowing to Draga's authority, acknowledging the ogre's unparalleled ability to enforce discipline and maintain order through brutal means. Draga's reign turned the prison into a place of fearful obedience, with even the most ambitious guards hesitating to cross the line drawn by the man-eating [[ogre]].

# Death

Dr. Draga, the formidable Brutal [[Ogre]] Slave Driver, met his untimely end during a violent prison riot within The Kiln, Sunderdune's notorious penitentiary. The riot, orchestrated by the Robertson brothers and a gang of orcs, was triggered by a cafeteria altercation that escalated into a full-scale rebellion against the oppressive conditions within the facility.

The catalyst for the riot occurred when a heated dispute erupted in the cafeteria between Draga and the Robertson brothers, renowned troublemakers within The Kiln. The confrontation quickly escalated, drawing the attention of the [[orc]] gang sympathetic to the brothers' cause. Tensions reached a boiling point, prompting a coordinated rebellion against the oppressive regime led by Draga.

As chaos ensued, inmates rallied against their oppressors, gaining control of sections of The Kiln. The uprising swiftly became a battle for freedom, with prisoners uniting against their common enemy. The orc gang, renowned for their prowess in combat, seized weapons within the prison, including the devastating Lucent Destroyer.

In the midst of the rebellion, the Robertson brothers and their [[orc]] allies brandished the formidable Lucent Destroyer, a weapon capable of emitting intense and destructive beams of energy. Its power became a symbol of defiance and a tool for the rebellion to dismantle the oppressive hierarchy within The Kiln.

As the riot raged on, Dr. Draga found himself at the forefront of the conflict, desperately attempting to quell the uprising. In a fateful confrontation, he faced off against the Robertson brothers and the [[orc]] gang. The Lucent Destroyer was unleashed, its destructive energy incinerating Draga. His demise marked a turning point in the rebellion, solidifying the prisoners' resolve to overthrow their oppressors and bring an end to the brutal regime that had ruled The Kiln for far too long.
